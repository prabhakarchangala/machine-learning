all machine learning algorithms 
Hereâ€™s a comprehensive list of **machine learning algorithms** used for **prediction tasks** (both regression and classification). These algorithms can be broadly categorized into **supervised learning** and **unsupervised learning** methods, but I'll focus on those commonly used for prediction purposes.

- **Polynomial Regression**
- **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**
- **Decision Tree Regressor**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
  - XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
  - LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine)
  - CatBoost
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression**
- **AdaBoost Regressor**

- **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**
- **Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)**

### 2. **Unsupervised Learning (for clustering and dimensionality reduction, not direct prediction)**
These algorithms are typically used for clustering or reducing dimensionality, but they can help inform prediction tasks (e.g., in semi-supervised learning).

- **K-Means Clustering**
- **Hierarchical Clustering**
- **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**
- **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** (Dimensionality Reduction)
- **Independent Component Analysis (ICA)**
- **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)** (Dimensionality Reduction)
- **Autoencoders** (Deep Learning method for unsupervised learning, often for feature extraction)

### 3. **Ensemble Methods** (For improving prediction accuracy by combining multiple models)
- **Bagging** (Bootstrap Aggregating)
  - **Random Forest** (For regression and classification)
- **Boosting**
  - **Gradient Boosting** (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)
  - **AdaBoost**
  - **Stochastic Gradient Boosting**
- **Stacking** (Combining predictions from multiple models)
- **Voting Classifier** (For classification tasks)
- **Blending** (Similar to stacking but with different methods for combining models)

### 4. **Deep Learning Models** (For prediction tasks in complex data scenarios like images, text, etc.)
- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** (Feed-forward neural networks)
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** (For image data)

- **Radial Basis Function (RBF) Neural Networks**

### 5. **Semi-Supervised Learning Algorithms** (For cases with limited labeled data)
- **Self-training Classifier**
- **Label Propagation**
- **Label Spreading**

### 6. **Reinforcement Learning Algorithms** (Used for decision-making, where the algorithm learns through trial and error, often used in gaming, robotics, and autonomous systems)
- **Q-Learning**
- **Deep Q Networks (DQN)**
- **Policy Gradient Methods**
- **Actor-Critic Methods**
- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**

### 7. **Other Models & Hybrid Algorithms**

### Summary:
1. **Regression** algorithms are used for predicting continuous values (e.g., price prediction, temperature forecasting).
2. **Classification** algorithms are used for predicting categorical outcomes (e.g., spam detection, image classification).
3. **Ensemble methods** combine multiple models to improve predictive performance.
4. **Deep learning** models are used for complex data like images, videos, and text.
5. **Reinforcement learning** is used in dynamic environments where the model learns through interaction.
